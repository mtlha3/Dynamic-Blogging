This project is a full-featured blogging website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It supports user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to protected routes. All CRUD operations are implemented with proper authentication where required, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their blog posts securely. The application also includes a comment section where authenticated users can engage with blog posts. It is designed with clean, scalable code and a responsive, user-friendly interface.
